### Exploratory Data Analysis

I explored the different datasets to answer the key questions below:

- Which product categories are selling well in the first half of 2015?
- Which country has the highest sales?
- Which company had the highest orders and sales?
- Identify the month that had peak sales and revenue and the month with the lowest sales and revenue?

### Findings

The results of my analysis are noted below as follows:
1. The company's revenue has increased steadily with a noticeable decline in May'15.
2. USA was the country with the highest sales
3. CÃ´te de Blaye was the best performing product based on revenue.
4. Beverages were the best sold category and should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Increased focus in promotions and further expansion in the beverages category.
- Invest more in products with high sales to increase revenue.
- Create a market strategy targeting customers in Sweden, UK and Venezuela to improve market share.
